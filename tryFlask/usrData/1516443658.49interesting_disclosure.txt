   This form contains information you will need in order to help you decide whether to take part in this screening test or not. Please read the form carefully and ask study team member(s) questions about anything that is not clear.

   STUDY PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE

   This is a research study, the results of which will be published at scientific conferences.  The purpose of this research study is to understand the kinds of variation currently managed with conditional compilation by languages like the C Preprocessor language (CPP). We will be focusing primarily on comparing users’ performance in reading and understanding, identifying and correcting errors in code (debugging), and adding new features to code in CPP and in a
   different environment, called “the plugin.”
    
    To be eligible for this screening, you need to be: (1) an adult (18+ years old) in a major in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department.

    SCREENING TEST

    To participate in the actual study, you are required to take part in a screening test, which is supposed to take less than 10 minutes. During this test, we will collect your name and email address as well as your test results. If you pass the test, we will contact you to schedule for the actual research study session, for which you will receive a compensation of {0 if you complete the session in full. In addition, your information and test results will be stored in a
    secure database that can only be accessed by members of our study group. If you do not pass the screening test, we will destroy your data.
     
     RISKS
     
     There are no foreseeable risks to you for participating in this screening test.
      
      BENEFITS
      
      This study is not designed to benefit you directly. Your participation will help us design tools that will produce better representations of variational code.
      
      CONFIDENTIALITY
      
      The information you provide during this screening test will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. To ensure confidentiality if you participate in the actual study you will be assigned a unique identification code and your name and email address will be deleted from our records (keeping only the identification codes). All research information will be stored securely. As the research data itself contains no personal information, even if there was a breach of
      confidentiality the risk would be minimal to you. Study data will be retained for a period of four years, after which all study data will be deleted.
      
      VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
      
      Taking part in this screening test is voluntary. You may choose to not take part at all. If you agree to take this test, you may stop at any time. If you decide not to take part, or if you stop taking at any time, your decision will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. If you withdraw from the test, your data will be destroyed. Declining to participate will not impact your grade, class standing or relationship with any instructor.
